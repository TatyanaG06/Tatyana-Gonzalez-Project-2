<p>This Past WNBA season has broken records for most viewership in WNBA history. The games were streamed across ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, CBS, ION, and NBA TV, with a record of more than 54 million viewers. The most viewed game this season was the Seattle Storm vs the Indiana Fever with 2.23 million views. NBA TV quadrupled its viewership from 2023 and ESPN had a 170% increase since last season. This sudden rise has been a result of what some call the Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese effect, the two rookies have had phenomenal first years in the WNBA but it didn’t start there, they gained fame in their college careers for their performances. </p>
